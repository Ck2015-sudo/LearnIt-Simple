    <p>Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. It keeps us on the ground and makes things fall when we drop them. Gravity also keeps the planets orbiting around the Sun.</p>
    <p>The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and how far apart they are. Bigger objects like planets have stronger gravity.</p>
