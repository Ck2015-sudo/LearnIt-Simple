    <p>The Vikings were people from the countries we now call Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. They lived about 1,000 years ago and are famous for sailing in strong longships across the sea.</p>
    <p>Vikings were very good sailors and traveled far to trade, explore, and sometimes raid places in Europe. But they were also farmers, craftsmen, and traders who lived in villages, built houses, and made beautiful things from metal and wood.</p>
    <p>Their ships, called longships, were fast and could travel in deep oceans and shallow rivers. This helped Vikings reach many different places — even North America long before most other Europeans.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: Some Vikings reached a place called Vinland (part of North America) around the year 1000 — almost 500 years before Columbus!</p>
