    <p>On Earth, the particles in the atmosphere mostly scatter blue light, this is why the sky is blue. The particles in the atmosphere act as a trampoline for light. Think of the atmosphere as a massive trampoline park.</p>
    <p>	In space, there are no trampolines (atmosphere particles), so the light weakens as it travels because there are no trampolines to give it more energy so most stars in the universe are so far away that the light gets too scattered and we can't see it. That is why Space is mostly black.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Light takes over 100 thousand (100,000) years to exit a star and travel into the universe.</p>
