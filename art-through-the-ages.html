    <p>Early Art</p>
    <p>Art dates back thousands of years. The first form of art was cave paintings, paintings drawn on cave walls using crushed berries and other natural substances.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Did you know the oldest cave painting is 51,200 years old in Indonesia!</p>
    <p>Medieval Art</p>
    <p>During the Medieval period, artists created beautiful mosaics and early Christian paintings. Churches had rounded arches, tall structures, and stained glass windows that told stories in bright colors.
Sculpture also became very popular. Artists made statues of people, animals, and religious scenes to decorate churches and important buildings.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Some stained glass windows are hundreds of years old and still shine with bright colors today!</p>
    <p>Renaissance Art</p>
    <p>The Renaissance was a time of amazing art and learning that started in Europe around 1400. Artists wanted their paintings and sculptures to look realistic, showing people, animals, and nature as they really appeared.</p>

Famous artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael created beautiful paintings, statues, and buildings that are still admired today. They studied human anatomy, light, and perspective to make their art lifelike.</p>

    <p>Fun Fact: Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world, and people still visit it in France every year!</p>
    <p>Baroque Art</p>
    <p>Baroque Art came after the Renaissance, around the 1600s. Artists during this time loved drama, movement, and bright colors in their paintings and sculptures.</p>
    <p>Baroque art often showed exciting scenes from history, religion, or mythology. Sculptures looked like they were moving, and paintings had strong contrasts  between light and dark to make them feel alive.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Some Baroque churches and palaces have gold decorations that sparkle in the sunlight — making them look magical!</p>
    <p>Neoclassicism And Romanticism</p>
    <p>After the Baroque period, artists in Europe explored two different styles.
Neoclassicism focused on order, balance, and classical ideas from Ancient Greece and Rome. Artists painted clean, simple scenes of history and mythology.</p>
<p>Romanticism was different — it was all about emotions, imagination, and adventure. Romantic artists painted dramatic landscapes, exciting stories, and heroic people.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Romantic painters sometimes painted wild storms or battles to make people feel the excitement!</p>
    <p>Modern Art</p>
    <p>Modern Art started in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Artists wanted to try new styles and ideas instead of copying what came before.<p/>
    <p>This period includes movements like Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Artists played with color, shapes, and imagination to create art that looked            completely new.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Pablo Picasso, a famous Cubist, painted people and objects from many angles at the same time!</p>
    <p>Contemporary/Digital Art</p>
    <p>Contemporary Art is the art made today. It includes all kinds of styles, from paintings and sculptures to photography, video, and digital creations.</p>
    <p>Artists can use computers, tablets, and 3D printers to make new and exciting art that didn’t exist in the past.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Some artists now make virtual reality (VR) art you can walk through and explore!</p>
