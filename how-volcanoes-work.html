    <p>Volcanoes happen when hot melted rock called magma rises from under the Earth and comes out as lava. Pressure builds under the ground until the magma finds a way out.</p>
    <p>There are different types of volcanoes: shield, composite, and cinder cones — each looks different and erupts differently.</p>
    <p>When a volcano erupts, a big, dark cloud of ash comes from the top of the volcano. This cloud is very dangerous, and many people have to leave their homes because of it. Lava also flows down the sides of the volcano — it’s super hot and can burn anything in its path, but it eventually cools and turns into solid rock.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Did you know that magma and lava are the same thing? It is called magma when it is underground and lava when on the ground.
