    <p>Cats purr for many reasons. Sometimes they are happy, sometimes they are nervous, and sometimes they purr to help heal themselves — purring can release vibrations that feel good.</p>
    <p>Purrs are usually between 25 and 150 Hertz — scientists think this range may help bones heal better!</p>
    <p>A Hertz (Hz) measures how many times something happens in one second, so when cats purr at 25 to 150 Hz, their bodies are vibrating 25 to 150 times every second.</p>
