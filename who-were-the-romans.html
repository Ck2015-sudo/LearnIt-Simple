    <p>The Romans were one of the biggest empires in history. Their empire controlled most of Europe and a small part of Africa.</p>
    <p>The capital city of the Roman empire was Rome. The Romans were very smart and could build beautiful structures and are the creators of the famous Aqueduct - a special structure used to take water to large cities.</p>
    <p>The Romans had a strong army and easily conquered many lands.</p>
